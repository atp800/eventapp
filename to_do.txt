Unique RSVP Links: When an event creator adds a list of people they're inviting, generate a unique RSVP link for each invitee. Each link would have an associated unique identifier (like a UUID or a secure token) that corresponds to a specific invitee's status for that event. This link would take them to a page where they can set their status without needing to log in.

Advantages: Easy for users to use since they don't need to create an account. Relatively secure since only someone with the link can change the status.
Disadvantages: If the link is shared, someone else could change the response. The links would need to be sent securely to the invitees (usually via email).
